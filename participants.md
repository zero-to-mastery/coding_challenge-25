## Matt#8280 - Twitter Bot

Having enjoyed building Discord bots in Javascript, I have always wanted to experiment with building a twitter bot and #30DayProject
seems like the ideal time. It should be an interesting project as I have never worked with the twitter API before.
Im not 100% sure on the features yet, I will define that once I get to grips with the basics. Feel free to connect with me on
Twitter/Linkedin, where I will likely document my journey alongside Discord!

## Brian(Brew)#9228 - Gatsby-Portfolio

I have been debating on creating a blog for a long time and decided I wanted to build it right into my portfolio. My old portfolio used just html/css and javascript. In order to update it I decided to move it to gatsby so I could take advantage of react and some of the really nice things gatsby does for data and static pages

## kylsiu#9227 - Web Idle Game

I am a professional video game developer and wanted to figure out a way to incorporate the ZTM work with that. I generally work with Unity3D/C# on mobile platforms so wanted to create a JavaScript game for browsers instead. My idea is to have an idle game with a funny story - mostly because I hate idle games and want to see if I can figure out how to make one people would like and therefore understand the underlying reasons on why people play them.

## green_arrow#9809 - Github Timeline

API's and graphical representation of information are hallmarks of modern web applications. GitHub Timeline combines the two to create a visual history of a users GitHub activity.

The goal of GitHub Timeline is accept a GitHub user name and produce a timeline containing each repo and annotated with the repo names, the date they were created, and their descriptions. The timeline should be one that could be shared with a prospective employer. It should be easy to read and make effective use of color and typography.

Only public GitHub repos will be displayed.

## skuld#0858 - Diabetes Self-management

API and client to add meals, blood glucose levels measurements, upload photos. I'd love to do some CV to recognize meal contents from photo, not sure if I'll have the time to do that. Also handle recipes, calculate carbohydrates, fluid intake... but I'd rather not bite more than I can chew :D  
Aiming to learn Docker, a CI/CD tool, DRF, React, and Heroku. And Google Drive and Dropbox APIs, but we'll see how it goes.

## Geometra #3174 - Numerik

Having learned about python in conjuction with jupyter notebooks, I find it a great open-source algebra system, that can be used in with libraries such as sympy for symbolics, numpy for linear algebra and numerics in general and ploting utilities available from matplotlib for example.
This project is just a collection of jupyter notebooks I am producing while studying a bit of numerical mathematics. It is a medium for me to understand the math, while at the same time experimenting with this newly learned way of doing algebra, numerics and plots in the computer.
One of the goals of the project is to practice also the use of virtual environments. Thus I created one and exported the dependencies to requirements.txt file.

## Perry#3337 = javascript-calculator

This is my #30DayProject for #ZeroToMastery. When started learning to code I quickly realized that I actually enjoy math, so I knew at some point I wanted to create a calculator. I've been thinking a lot lately about what I want to create to really showcase on my resume/portfolio, and I think a fully functioning graphing calculator would be awesome. There's obviously a lot that goes into a graphing calculator and there's a lot of learning left for me to do, but I thought #30dayproject would be the perfect opportunity to put pen to paper and just create a basic calculator.
