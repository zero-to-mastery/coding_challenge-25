## Matt#8280 - Twitter Bot
Having enjoyed building Discord bots in Javascript, I have always wanted to experiment with building a twitter bot and #30DayProject 
seems like the ideal time. It should be an interesting project as I have never worked with the twitter API before. 
Im not 100% sure on the features yet, I will define that once I get to grips with the basics. Feel free to connect with me on 
Twitter/Linkedin, where I will likely document my journey alongside Discord!

## Brian(Brew)#9228 - Gatsby-Portfolio
I have been debating on creating a blog for a long time and decided I wanted to build it right into my portfolio.  My old portfolio used just html/css and javascript. In order to update it I decided to move it to gatsby so I could take advantage of react and some of the really nice things gatsby does for data and static pages

## kaem#6578 - Five-on-4
5-a-side football match organizer, to make it easier for friends and colleagues to organize and play football matches. I would like users to be able to create match events, signup for matches and see other players that signed up. I will also try to implement match reports feature, to get matches and players' profiles with simple statistics such as matches participation and goals. Weather forecast for dates when matches are played would also be nice...
