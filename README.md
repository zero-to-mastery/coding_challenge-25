# coding_challenge-25 - 30 Day Project

This coding challenge is all about **starting 2020 on the right path and dedicating 30 days of code to build something great.**. 2020 is now upon us and many of you have big career goals for this year. One of the best things you can do for your career as a programmer, is to build things from scratch yourself. Not in one day. But a big project that takes you several days. To start the 2020 year right, we are all going to do the **#30dayproject**! That means, ever day for 30 days straight, you have to work on your project and present it at the end of 30 days (You can't work on it for longer than 30 days.. that is the limit)!

Please Use the **#coding-challenge** channel on Discord to discuss and share your work. At the end of the challenge, I will compile everyone's submitted websites/projects/code on here.

## What are the Rules?
1. You have to commit to 30 days. It doesn't matter how much you work each day. All that matters is that you do at least something every day toward your project. It can be as little as wirting a README file, or doing research, or as big as pushing code to Github with a new feature. 
2. Every day, you have to let us know what you did in one of 2 ways: [Tweet on Twitter](https://twitter.com/AndreiNeagoie), or if you don't have Twitter in the **#coding-challenge** channel on Discord let us know what you worked on using the **#30dayproject and #zerotomastery hashtags**. For example I might say on twitter: **Today I pushed my first index.html file to Github for Day 1 of #30dayproject #zerotomastery**
3. Every day you have to let others know what you have done so you keep yourself accuntable and you get to see what others are working on. At the end of 30 days (January 30th or January 31st), you will have to submit your project that you have worked on so you share it with the community. Read below to see how to submit your project!

## Student Submissions:

At the end of the challenge, I will compile everyone's submitted websites/projects/code on here.

## How to Submit Your Project at the end of 30 days:

1. **You have until Janury 31st at 11:59pm EST** to submit your project (using Github. If you don't know how to do that, check out the lecture in the Git + Github section of the course). You will have to submit the link to the **#coding-challenge** Discord group with the following message:  *-challenge URL LINK TO YOUR ENTRY"* . The bot will listen for the command in any channel it is in and will reply with "thanks for your submission" if it succeeded.

2. Use whatever tools you have as developers (google, friends, Discord, programming buddy etc...) but I will not be offering any help with this challenge. Just like a developer, you must solve a problem and build something that will be challenging. Nobody will hold your hand during the job so we want to experience that by figuring it all out on your own with your team. 

*** **Please note: As with all my challenges there is zero benefit or monetary gain I recieve from it. This is just my way of thanking my students and making sure that you are able to continue gaining valuable knowledge outside of just my videos. It would mean a lot to me if you are able to rate my course...5 star reviews make my day :)**
